# Hindleyâ€“Milner Type System

Elm, Haskell, ML, and many others.

Parametric polymorphism
`[] : List a`

Can be inferred at *compile time* without type annotations.

---

# Type Classes (Ad-hoc Polymorphism)

Unlike Haskell or PureScript, Elm has no support for higher-kinded types.

For example, there is no generic map, apply, fold, or filter function. Instead, such names are used prefixed by their module, such as List.map and Dict.map.

# Type Signature Examples

```
> String.length

<function> : String -> Int

> divide x y = x / y

<function> : Float -> Float -> Float
```

# Type Signatures Explained

To start out, it is fine to think that "all the arguments are separated by arrows, and whatever is last is the result of the function".

See [Reading Types](https://guide.elm-lang.org/types/reading_types.html) for more info on currying and partial application.

# How is this different than JavaScript or TypeScript?

JavaScript, Python, Ruby, even TypeScript are based on gradual typing. Some checking takes place at compile time, some at *runtime*.

These language use a subset of dynamic typing known as duck typing. In duck typing, an object's type is determined by the presence of certain methods and properties, rather than the actual type of the object.

# Error Handling
Java, C, JavaScript, Python, or Ruby.. you have almost certainly had your code crash because of null values or surprise exceptions from someone else's code.

[Error handling](https://guide.elm-lang.org/error_handling/) in Elm forces us to explicitly deal with invalid input.

# Error Handling Example

```
type alias User =
  { name : String
  , age : Maybe Int
  }

canBuyAlcohol : User -> Bool
canBuyAlcohol user =
  case user.age of
    Nothing ->
      False

    Just age ->
      age >= 21

```
---

# Records
User in the prior example is a "record" or a set of key-value pairs, similar to objects in JavaScript or Python. You cannot ask for a field that does not exist. No field will ever be undefined or null.

`point = { x = 3, y = 4 }`

---

# Structural Typing

Records also support [structural typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_type_system) which means records in Elm can be used in any situation as long as the necessary fields exist. This gives us flexibility without compromising reliability (the check happens at compile time).

---

# Type Aliases

The whole point of type aliases is to make your type annotations easier to read.

```
type alias User =
  { name : String
  , bio : String
  , pic : String
  }
```

---

# Algebraic Data Types (ADTs)
* Product Types
* Sum Types or "Union Types" (super important in Elm!)

---

---
# Product Types
* Logical AND
* Q: How many possible values in a 32 bit integer?
* A: 2^32 ~4bn
* So what about a string?
* A function that takes 5 strings?

---

# Sum Types or "Union Types" in Elm
* Logical OR
* type Salsa = "Red" | "Green"
* Q: How many possible values for salsa?
* A: 2

# Polymorphism with Union Types

Elm's union types let you represent complex data much more naturally.

```
type User = Anonymous | Named String

userPhoto : User -> String
userPhoto user =
  case user of
    Anonymous ->
      "anon.png"

    Named name ->
      "users/" ++ name ++ ".png"
```
