# Can it help me get a job?
* YES
* Isolating *side effects* [improves code](https://www.aomran.com/pure-functional-programming/)
* *Immutable data* has [advantages](https://redux.js.org/docs/faq/ImmutableData.html#benefits-of-immutability)

# Objectives
* Identify destructive functions, mutated state, and side effects
* Write functions that take functions as arguments
* Write functions that return functions as values
* Write non-destructive versions of common destructive functions

# What is Functional Programming (FP)?
* A programming *paradigm* like imperative, declarative, object-oriented, etc.
* FP is *declarative* utilizing expressions rather than statements
* *Higher-order functions* allow partial application and currying

# What is Functional Programming (FP)?
* *Recursion* is used in place of loops
* Pure functions have no *side effects* giving us referential transparency
* *Immutable data* - Array.map, Object.assign, String
